Attention DOWNFALL modders: Here's the instructions.

Setup guide:
1. Rename the enclosing mod folder. (the folder just under Java, initially named theTimeEater.)
2. Set your modID in the main Mod file. (initially TodoMod).
3. Rename the main mod file. (the class initially named TodoMod, not in a folder.)
4. Rename the mod's Resources folder. (the folder under the "resources" folder, initially named todomodResources. The change needs to match your mod ID, plus "Resources". IE: if your modid is "blah", "blahResources".)
5. Rename the modded character file. (the class initially named TheTodo, not in a folder.)
6. In the modded character file, go to the Enums section at the bottom and change the PlayerClass and CardColor enums. They're also annotated with TODOs.
7. You'll need to go into downfallMod and refactor->Rename the package name of the todo-character. There's a TODO marked there.
8+. Finally, go into the strings files and find-and-replace todomod with your new mod ID. From there, it's just making the mod of your dreams!
